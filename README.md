## 🎮 The Infinity Gauntlet — Two-Layer Left-Hand Keyboard System

Designed for AI Orchestrator + Data Analyst workflow. **Right hand never leaves the mouse.** All navigation, capture, tab management, and window control happens via the left hand.

### Layer architecture

| Trigger | Modifier emitted | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Caps Lock** (held) | ⌃⇧⌘ | Layer 1 — nav, capture, window snap |
| **Backtick `~`** (held) | ⌃⌥⇧ (Meh) | Layer 2 — tab management |
| Tab (tap or hold) | — | Pure Tab, unchanged |
| Right CMD | ⌃⇧⌘⌥ (full Hyper) | Reserved for future expansion |

### Layer 1 — Caps Lock (⌃⇧⌘)

**Nav cluster**

| Caps + | Action |
|---|---|
| **Q** | Browser Back (⌘[) |
| **W** | Page Up |
| **E** | Browser Forward (⌘]) |
| **R** | End |
| **T** | ↑ (up one line) |
| **A** | ← |
| **S** | Page Down |
| **D** | → |
| **F** | Home |
| **G** | ↓ (down one line) |

**Capture + quick actions**

| Caps + | Action |
|---|---|
| **C** | Full-screen screenshot → clipboard (native ⌃⇧⌘C) |
| **V** | Paste without formatting (⌘⇧V) |
| **X** | Shottr — region screenshot + annotations (highlight, text, draw) |
| **Z** | Reopen closed tab (⌘⇧T) |

**Window snap (Rectangle)**

| Caps + | Action |
|---|---|
| **1** | Left snap |
| **2** | Right snap |
| **3** | Fullscreen |

### Layer 2 — Backtick `~` (Meh ⌃⌥⇧)

| ~ + | Action |
|---|---|
| **1** | Previous tab |
| **2** | Next tab |
| **3** | New tab |
| **4** | 🔓 Free (earn it) |
| **5** | Close tab |

### Open slots (design space)

| Layer | Free keys |
|---|---|
| Caps | B · 4 · 5 · 6-0 |
| ~ (Meh) | most letters · 4 · 6-0 |

## 🧬 Design Principles (derived through iteration)

1. **Left pinky anchored** on modifier = zero-travel ergonomics. Caps Lock is the canonical choice — pinky already rests there.
2. **Right hand stays on mouse** — the whole point of the system. HJKL (Vim default) is on the right hand and defeats this.
3. **WASD > HJKL** for arrow nav — gamer muscle memory from 30 years of FPS games, not Vim.
4. **Backtick > Tab** as Layer 2 trigger — avoids 200ms dual-function delay on the heavily-used Tab key.
5. **Modifier rows match action rows** — Caps is home row → actions on home row letters. `~` is top row → actions on top row digits.
6. **Non-overlapping modifier chains** — Caps (⌃⇧⌘, no Option) + Meh (⌃⌥⇧, no Cmd) → zero conflicts between layers.
7. **Rest & learn** — don't add bindings faster than muscle memory can absorb (~1 week per batch).
8. **Earn your features** — new bindings must replace a real pain point, not fill slots aspirationally.

## 📸 Shottr Setup

Shottr replaces macOS's native region screenshot with a proper annotation pipeline.

**Configuration:**
1. Install from [shottr.cc](https://shottr.cc)
2. Click "Run at Startup"
3. Preferences → Hotkeys → set **Area screenshot** to **⌃⇧⌘X**
4. Preferences → General → After capture → "Open Editor" (for annotation access)

**Result:** Caps+X triggers Shottr. Drag region → toolbar appears → highlight, type, draw, blur. ⌘C copies annotated image. Paste into Claude/ChatGPT/Slack.

## 🔁 Raycast Automations

### Notion Clipper (`Cmd+Shift+N`)
Captures clipboard text and saves it simultaneously to:
- **Notion** — CLAUDE NOTES page via API
- **Local file** — `~/Desktop/clips.txt`

Script: see [raycast-automation repo](https://github.com/DimmMak/raycast-automation)

## ⌨️ Karabiner Setup

The Infinity Gauntlet lives in 5 Complex Modifications rules. Import `karabiner.json` or manually add via **Complex Modifications → Add your own rule**.

### Rule 1 — Hyper Key: Caps Lock → ⌃⇧⌘
Maps held Caps Lock to the 3-modifier chord. Tap Caps Lock → Escape (if configured) or nothing.

### Rule 2 — Backtick `~` → Meh (⌃⌥⇧) when held, `` ` `` when tapped
Dual-function key. Preserves backtick typing, adds Layer 2 modifier.

### Rule 3 — Left-hand nav layer v4 (Q/E=browser back/fwd, R/F=End/Home, T/G=arrows)
10 manipulators. Q/E flank W as horizontal browser back/forward pair (semantic). R=End, F=Home (F=home row → home position mnemonic). T/G vertical pair = ↑/↓.

### Rule 4 — Meh (~) + 1/2/3/5 → Tab actions
Tab switching (1/2), new tab (3), close tab (5). ~+4 left intentionally free for future earn-it bindings.

### Rule 5 — Caps+Z → Reopen closed tab (⌘⇧T)
Standalone rule. Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, VS Code, Terminal.

### Rule 6 — Caps+V → Paste without formatting (⌘⇧V)
Standalone rule. The mnemonic chain: ⌘V = paste, ⌘⇧V = paste-no-format, Caps+V = paste-no-format one-handed.

**Rationale for 3-modifier Hyper (not 4):** Using ⌃⇧⌘ (no Option) + Meh ⌃⌥⇧ (no Cmd) = non-overlapping modifier sets. Both layers coexist without conflict. True 4-modifier Hyper would make Meh a subset of Hyper and break Layer 2.

## 🌀 Mac Workflow

### The feedback loop (debugging with Claude)
1. Error appears on screen
2. `Caps+X` → Shottr region capture with annotations (highlight + arrow)
3. `Caps+L` (Raycast hotkey) → open Claude app
4. `Cmd+V` → paste annotated screenshot (or `Caps+V` if pasting plain text)
5. Fix → paste in terminal → repeat

### Tab-swim workflow
- `~+2` → next Claude tab
- `~+1` → previous tab
- `Caps+Z` → reopen tab you just accidentally closed

### Side-by-side setup
- Terminal → `Ctrl+Option+U` (top left)
- Claude → `Ctrl+Option+I` (top right)
- Notion → `Ctrl+Option+J` (bottom left)
- Browser → `Ctrl+Option+K` (bottom right)

## 📝 Muscle memory timeline

| Day | What you feel |
|---|---|
| 1-2 | Peeking at the legend often — normal |
| 3-4 | Fingers hesitate, brain still consulting |
| 5-7 | Reflex starts taking over |
| 14+ | Automatic — can't describe it but hands know |
| 30+ | Panic-reach on other people's keyboards |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Add BetterTouchTool trackpad gestures
- [ ] Add Hammerspoon scripts
- [ ] Add VS Code extensions list
- [ ] Add Python/data analyst environment setup (conda, jupyter)
- [ ] Add dotfiles (.zshrc, .gitconfig)
- [ ] Fill open Caps layer slots (X, B, 4, 5) when workflow pain points earn them
- [ ] Design Layer 2 expansion (~ + letters) for cross-tool actions
- [ ] Consider Layer 3 trigger (right-side modifier or key combo)
